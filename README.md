# A-Latent-Class-Model-to-Cluster-Preferences

Abstract


In this study, we examine the heterogeneity in people’s preferences to understand the different perspectives of fairness that exist, from survey responses. A latent class model was built to identify unobservable subgroups amongst the respondents to examine the specific preference patterns of each of the clusters formed. The latent class model computes the class membership probabilities of the responses and also estimates the preference parameters for each class using the expectation maximization algorithm. The model is used to fit the survey data i.e. the responses to survey questions requiring participants to choose the person they think is most fair to receive a particular service. The resulting clusters show how perceptions of fairness vary with the context of the service to be provided.
